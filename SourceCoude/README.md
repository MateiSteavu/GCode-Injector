This is a GCode Injection project used to inject GCode into existing GCode (only for 3D printers)

It has a number of features, such as printing with customizable speeds (this was relevant when I first developed the project).
It's a simple .NET prject in Visual Studio, I do think you should be able to build it on your own.

Since the project is rather old (it was developed 3 years ago) and I was in 11th grade in high school when I coded it,
it is highly inneficient (too inneficient), so I do recommend you check out other stuff and ONLY take inspiration for my project.

I am currently working on a custom GCode Slicer, I will update this project when that one is ready.
